# Employee-Performance-Score-Classification



A Data Science Project on the employee peformance rating using machine larning techniques like Logistic Regression , kNeighbors , Support Vector Machine Algorithm,Random Forest. Performance rating is the step in the work measurement in which the analyst observes the worker's performance and records a value representing that performance relative to the analyst's concept of standard performance. 




Used Machine learning techniques:


Logistic Regression : Logistic Regression is easier to implement , interpret and very efficient to train. It is very fast at classifying unknown records. It is useful when variable to be predicted is categorical.


KNeighbors : KNeighbors Classifier implements classification based on voting by nearest K-Neighbors of target point. KNN classifies the new data points based on the similarity mesure of the earlier stored data points. 


Support Vector Machine : Support Vector Machine is used for classification and regression but it is well suited for classification . The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies th data points. The dimensions of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features.


Random Forest : Random Forest is a sophisticated and adaptive machine learning technique that create and combines a large number of decision tree to create a "forest". A number of decision trees are used on distinct subsets of the same dataset , and the average is used to improve the dataset's projected accuracy.
